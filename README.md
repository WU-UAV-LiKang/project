# Flocking algorithm for autonomous flying robots

## Built in Java environment



## Conclusions

At the experiment stage, we have made many experiments with different algorithm's parameters, so
we can better understand how the algorithm responds with various variables value.
According to first experiment, we can see that increasing of the C-Frict parameter in 150% effect, the
distance between the flock members is less stable, and the progress to the target become slower.
From experiment 2, we can see that if we decrease the C-Shill parameter with more than half, the
movements become more sharp and unpredictable. Because of these movements, there is a greater
chance of contact / collisions between the flock members.
We learn from last experiment, that when the R-0 variable is larger so the stability of the drones in their
flight area is much unexpected and the drones stay in their flight area in even if they contact to other
drones in the flock.
In conclusion, we get the expected result from different experiments with different values to various
variables. We can see that our project reached to the result we search with this project.
